# Imaging RoboRIO
At the start of each season, any new RoboRIO's, or ones on old firmware need to be reimaged.
[The following guide will explain the process](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/getting_started/l/144984-imaging-your-roborio). Note that the RoboRio acts as the brain of the robot and is what processes the code.

# Configuring Radio
A Radio is needed to be able to wirelessly communicate between the robot and field/computers. If the radio isn't already configured for FRC or is set to competition mode, [the following guide will explain the process](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/144986-programming-your-radio-for-home-use) to re-configure it.
