5. For the newly created project, click the dropdown arrow and you will see JRE System Library and src. Right click src and select New->Package. Give the package a name and click "Finish".
    * Generally, package names should be all lowercase and contain no spaces and symbols.
6. Right click the newly created package and select New->Class. Select the "public static void main(String[] args)" checkbox and name the class. Since this is the class containing the main method, it is generally called Main.
